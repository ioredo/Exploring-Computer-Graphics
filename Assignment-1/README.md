A good example of Web-GL Technology in use can be found at the following address https://experiments.withgoogle.com/a-journey-through-middle-earth .

There is also a blog post found here https://blog.chromium.org/2013/11/a-journey-through-middle-earth-chrome.html .
In this post the "chromium" team overviews the web-gl based game of 2013 called "a-journey-through-middle-earth".

Another example of web-gl based software can be found at this address http://www.zephyrosanemos.com/windstorm/current/live-demo.html .
This example demonstrates a realistic view of "terrain" and "sky" with some movement controls in a type of "flight-mode".
